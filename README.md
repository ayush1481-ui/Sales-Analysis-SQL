### 🚀 The Challenge We Tackled

Sales teams often operate without a clear, data-driven view of regional performance, making it tough to spot growth opportunities and use resources efficiently. Our project directly addresses this by aiming to:

* **Analyze & Visualize Regional Sales Data:** Uncover hidden trends, evaluate profitability, and support smarter strategic decisions.
* **Solve Key Business Questions:**
    * Why is revenue and profit inconsistent across U.S. regions?
    * What's driving our seasonal swings, top product performance (SKUs), and channel profitability?
* **Our Big Goal:** Leverage **5 years of historical data** to pinpoint exact growth levers and supercharge our sales strategy!

### ✨ Our Data-Driven Approach

We followed a robust, end-to-end analytics pipeline to turn data into insights:

1.  **🔍 Problem Understanding:** Deep-dived into the core business challenges to define clear objectives and key questions.
2.  **🧺 Data Collection:** Gathered comprehensive raw sales data.
3.  **🧼 Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Utilized **SQL** for robust data cleaning, ensuring accuracy and consistency across the dataset. This crucial step prepared our data for meaningful analysis.
4.  **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed in-depth analysis using **Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy** to understand data distributions, relationships, and preliminary trends, laying the groundwork for effective visualizations.
5.  **📈 Interactive Visualization:** Leveraged **Power BI** to create dynamic and intuitive dashboards, bringing the cleaned and analyzed data to life for executive overviews, product & channel insights, and geographic analysis.
